# Week Four

## Summary

### What I learned
- Writing this in week five, I think week four was the week with the most new concepts so far. Compared to previous weeks, these tasks felt more fiddly. It was certainly a transition away from logical programming to organising database connections.
- Overall, I found it really interesting. It feels like we're spinning plates and two more were added at once.
- We used PostgresSQL and I learned about the PG connection. This allowed me to use data from databases we had connected. I didn't expect we would have to make test databases.

### What I built
- The afternoon challenge was building a bookmark application. With my pairs, I was able to build an application which allowed users to enter their bookmark and list them all at once. This was useful for the weekend challenge.
- I had to make waves with the weekend challenge earlier in the week due to lack of time at the weekend. This was building a fake Twitter - it displays the "peeps" and allows a user to login.
- I've been improving this is in week five as it's a satisfying task.
